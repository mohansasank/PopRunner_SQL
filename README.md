# PopRunner_SQL
The analysis focused on evaluating the impact of online advertising on PopRunner's sales, using descriptive statistics and SQL queries to explore customer demographics, engagement with advertisements, and sales patterns. Descriptive statistics and SQL queries were employed to analyze four key tables: email, pop_up, consumer, and purchase. 
The study revealed that email advertising had a substantial impact on sales, with customers who opened emails exhibiting significantly higher average sales compared to non-openers. On average, customers who opened emails spent $240.83, whereas non-openers had an average spending of $126.12. In contrast, pop-up advertisements showed a more subtle effect on sales, with a modest difference in average spending between recipients and non-recipients. The average spending for those who received pop-up ads was $131.74, while non-recipients spent slightly more with an average of $138.69.
The findings suggest that tailored email marketing is more effective in driving sales compared to pop-up advertisements. However, a holistic approach combining both advertising methods could be advantageous to target specific consumer segments effectively.
Management is advised to integrate pop-up ads and email blasts for optimized visibility. Personalized ad content based on consumer preferences is crucial, and continuous monitoring should guide swift adjustments. Establishing direct feedback mechanisms and exploring additional advertising channels, such as social media, are recommended. Experimenting with innovative content formats, ensuring cross-channel consistency, and refining feedback loops using AI can enhance targeted advertising. Strategic partnerships with brands or influencers should be explored for extended reach.
The analysis has certain limitations, including the absence of forecasting figures, limited information on the nature and type of the company, and potential data limitations due to insufficient details provided.
